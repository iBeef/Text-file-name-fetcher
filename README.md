# Text-file-name-fetcher
A short script I wrote to copy text file names in the current working directory.

To collate some results for a process at work, a spreadsheet imports text files from its current working directory.
To do this you have to manually copy the text file names into the spreadsheet so it knows which files to look for. I wrote this
script so that it will automatically copy any text file names onto the clipboard ready to be pasted into the spreadsheet.
